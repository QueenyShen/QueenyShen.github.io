        When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, 
    </p>   
    <p class="covered-text">
        he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” he is absolutely
    </p>   
    <p class="covered-text">
        right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward
    <p class="covered-text">
       and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time 
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing,
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated. 
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        semicolon, what connects the first line to the last, the
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        apart. Between the first and last lines there exists—
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        a poem—and if it were not for the poem that
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem would
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        not speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        are speaking to each other, not you to them or they 
    </p> 
    <p class="covered-text">
        to you.
