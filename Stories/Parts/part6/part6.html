    <div class="text">Roland Barthes suggests there are<br> three ways  to finish any piece of <br>writing: the ending will have the<br>last word or the ending will be<br> silent or the ending will execute a <br>pirouette, do something unexpectedly <br> incongruent.
        Gaston Bachelard says<br> the single most succinct and astonishing <br> thing: We begin in admiration and <br> we end by organizing our disappointment. <br>The moment of admiration is the <br> experience of something unfiltered,<br> vital and fresh—it could also be <br> horror—and the moment of organization <br> is both the onset of disappointment <br> and its dignification; the least we <br> can do is dignify our knowingness,<br>the loss of some vitality through <br>familiarization, by admiring not  <br>the thing itself but how we can <br>organize it, think about it. 
         I am<br>afraid there is no way around this.<br> It is the one try inevitable thing.<br> And if you believe that, then you <br>are conceding that in the beginning<br> was the act, not the word.
