        <b>Hi I'm Queeny Shen.<br></b>
        I’m from Shenzhen China, but I grew up in Canada and moved back to China during primary school.
        <br>And I LOVE GAMING.
        <br>I'm currently a sophomore student studying communication design at Parsons.

        <b><br>Why did I choose CD?</b>
        <br>At the very beginning, I wasn’t entirely sure whether I really wanted to study graphic design specifically. On the other hand I was quite interested in this area , but didn’t want to limit my choices, therefore I chose CD.
        Compared to graphic design majors at other universities, I believe that CD at Parsons would give me the opportunity to learn and explore a bit more than what is just graphic design.
