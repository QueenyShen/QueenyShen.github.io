      <h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h3>
      <p>
        For this project, I collected books from different sources, including my own collection, those of my friends, a local bookstore, and the university library. I decided to gather words from the 36th page of each book, 
        whether or not the book contained the page. Each word was either the 3rd or 6th word on the page. I chose the number 36 due to my superstitious beliefs, as 3 and 6 are considered lucky numbers in my culture. In Chinese,
         "3" sounds similar to "生" (Sheng), which means growth and is associated with making money, while "6" has the connotation of "顺" (Shun), meaning things would go smoothly and successfully.
      </p>
      <p>In addition, I designed a writing-mode for the website which allows users to create their own poems or texts. I selected books in different languages so that users can construct sentences
         freely, either according to the meaning of the words or their pronunciations.
      </p>
